            <br>
            120 g unsweetened plant-based milk (120 ml | 1/2 cup)
            <br>
            20 g chia seeds (2 tablespoons)
            <br>
            10 g white sugar or coconut sugar or demerara sugar (2 teaspoons)
            <br><br>
            Preparation method:
            <br>
            Separate all the ingredients and measure them, leaving them ready to start the recipe. This step is important for the success of your recipe, as it avoids surprises in the middle of the process.
            <br><br>
            Mix milk and sugar: add 60 g (1/4 cup) of drinking coconut milk, 5 g (1 teaspoon) of sugar. Mix well until the sugar dissolves.
            <br><br>
            Add the chia seeds: Place 10 g (1 tablespoon) of chia seeds in each small bowl with the coconut milk and sugar mixture. Stir well so that the seeds do not clump together. Let sit for 5 minutes.
            <br><br>
            Refrigerate: after 5 minutes of resting, the seeds will be partially gelled, stir again to prevent the seeds from clumping together. Cover the containers and place in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours.
            <br><br>
            Serve: Stir the chia pudding before serving and add fresh fruit, nuts, shredded coconut, etc.

            Tips:
            <br>
            We recommend using coconut milk to drink or cashew milk as they are tastier.
            <br>
            You can add flavoring ingredients in addition to the basic ingredients, such as vanilla, cinnamon, etc.'
